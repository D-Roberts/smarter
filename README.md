Restarting refactor. This is the step-by-step code I am working with to architect and train the vlm reasoners step by step for the final project DL 7643 due to concerns with regards to the behavior of associate on the team.

I am not sure what he is up to. He insisted of not writing anything in overleaf, or in code so far. (7 days to submission deadline). From start (Feb1) he insisted that I generated all the research ideas and literature summaries in his Notion account first. Now he speaks of involvement of unknown coworkers. At proposal submission time there was (documented) suspicious behavior.

I hope PACE has privacy and security on student's folders. OMSCS is a large program with people from everywhere not vetted by the US embassies for Visa purposes like the rest of us (naturalized citizens) who came to the US with student visas and are on the US territory. 

On my part, for this project, I commit to github repos and Comet log training of models. I also have overleaf history and a copy of the Notion page with all my work starting Feb1, at all stages.
