Restarting refactor. This is the actual code I am working with to architect and train the vlm reasoners step by step for the final project DL 7643 due to the suspicious behavior of the guy I am supposed to be on the team with.

I am not sure what he is up to but his insistance of not writing anything in overleaf, or in code and that I generated all the reserach ideas and literature summaries in his Notion account first and now this stuff with his work colleagues which came out of the blue..All is not well. And that stuff he pulled at proposal submission which I have documented from this Notion thing he insisted to use. 

I hope PACE has privacy and security on student's folders.

For now I am just making sure I keep commits for history. I will be going to demo at TA the office hours. 

All I can do is git commit, comet log, and overleaf history track.
