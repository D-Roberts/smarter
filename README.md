Restarting refactor. This is the step-by-step code I am working with to architect and train the vlm reasoners step by step for the final project DL 7643 due to concerns with regards to the behavior of the associate on the team. This is the repo in my personal git profile.

I am not sure what the person is up to. He insisted on him not writing anything in overleaf, or in code so far. (7 days to submission deadline). From start (Feb1) he insisted that I generated all the research ideas and literature summaries in his Notion account first. Now he speaks of involvement of unknown coworkers. At proposal submission time there was (documented) concerning behavior.

I hope PACE has privacy and security on student's folders. 

On my part, for this project, I commit to github repos and Comet log training of models. I also have overleaf history and a copy of the Notion page with all my work starting Feb1, at various project stages.
