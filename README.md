Restarting refactor. This is the actual code I am working with to architect and train the vlm reasoners step by step for the final project DL 7643 due to the suspicious behavior of the guy I am supposed to be on the team with.

I am not sure what he is up to but his insistance of not writing anything in overleaf, or in code and that I generated all the reserach ideas in his Notion account first and now this stuff with his work colleagues which came out of the blue..All is not well. 

I hope he cannot access my PACE directory where I train the models for vlm reasoners but if he does ... I suppose I will know only when it is too late.

For now I am just making sure I keep commits for history. I will be going to demo at all the office hours starting Sunday. Friday Instructor office hour is recorded and shared with all of the students and Ahmad probably listens so I am not sure even how to talk about my work on the project and my research and ideas. This is not good. 

All I can do is commit and share now. I plan to email my work as well.
